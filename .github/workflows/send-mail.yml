name: Send News

# This workflow will run every 10 minutes, check if there is a new post
# available via the Wordpress feed and send that via email.
#
# The workflow will use a given git repository for storing the list of post
# which have already been processed.
#
# Only one mail is sent on each run to avoid sending too many mails at once and
# to not send mails twice if the workflow fails half-way through.
